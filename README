Welcome to the ViOS project,
this is an attempt to write an OS for the x86 architecture.
The project is (almost) fully written in C++.
The goal is to write a mostly monolithic kernel.
As for naming, i am not sure yet, both ViOS and Vidad seem nice.

After a half-succesfull attempt in early 2011, i am now doing a full rewrite.
(Now is early january 2012)


===== Outline of the project ===================================================

The ViOS kernel consists of the following parts, whose names are the same
on directories and on namespaces.

==> A bootloader, specifically written for the kernel.
==> Some functions for early kernel init (*_entry files).

==> util, contains memory (memcpy/memset), string, and kernel output functions.
	As the project goes along several parts of needed functionality may
	be added (think of locks).

==> system, contains the main part of startup/shutdown code.

==> memory, the memory management code, provides both physical memory management
	(paging) and logical memory management (new/delete).
==> stream, contains the interface for the stream/device model. Most data is
	transferred throug a stream.
==> event, contains the code for the event subsystem, all sorts of "events"
	are passed throug this system, IRQ's, some keystrokes, signals.
==> thread, provides the code for multithreading.

==> process, manages processes and exposes kernel functions to userspace.
==> IO, contains all in-kernel drivers.


===== Status of the project ====================================================
(as of June 11, 2012)

==> Bootloader done.
==> *_entry files mostly complete.
==> util contains several useful functions.
==> system contains a bit of startup code.
==> memory is mostly functional.
==> stream: there is a rather complete header.
==> thread: works, but there is a need for a better scheduling algo.
==> there are port io functions in io, and there is work done on the
	root/legacy devices.

And that's about it.


===== Further planning =========================================================

The stream/device interface should be completed, this requires writing a system
for translating device/file numbers to Stream pointers.
We will need a proper screen driver, i will postpone writing a PCI driver.
I'll start working on the legacy devices.

Keyboard handling will require irq's and thus event, which, when finished
should make it possible to finally have a functional terminal!

Apart from user programs the kernel proper should than be functional, i will
than add several drivers.

==> Apart from that i will try adding bootblocks for harddisk (PATA?/SATA?),
	CD-ROM (El-Torito no-emulation), and multiboot (Grub).


===== Building && running ======================================================

ViOS now uses Scons to build.

Compiling ViOS works best when using a cross-compiler, but any ordinary
compiler (with gcc-style inline asm) should do. Changing 'Csonset' should do.


To buid the kernel run:
	scons
in the main dir.


To test you need bochs, just run:
	bochs

If you want to test it on a real computer, you'll need to have a floppy drive.
First copy the kernel to the floppy (this will shred the floppy!):
	dd if=image of=/dev/fd0u1440 count=72
and then reboot to test it. (at your own risk)


===== Contact ==================================================================

The Vidad kernel is written by D.L.Buunk (dlbuunk@gmail.com).

Issues can be submitted to the issue tracker of the main Vidad repository.

NOTE: the kernel/bootloader is released under the GPL version 2.
