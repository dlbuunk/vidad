# is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, CSharp, C,
# C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make
# doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C
# (default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C. Note that for custom extensions
# you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise the files are not read by doxygen.

# containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that
# is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports

# Windows users are probably better off using the HTML help feature.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES
